# End-to-end tests

These tests are implemented in Python and can be executed either using the [Speculos](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos) emulator or a Ledger Nano S/X.

All the commands in this folder are meant to be ran from the `tests` folder, not from the root.

Python dependencies are listed in [requirements.txt](../requirements.txt), install them using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) from the root of the repository:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Launch with Speculos

Build the app as normal for mainnet from the root folder:

```
COIN=bitcoin DEBUG=0 make
```

Then run all the tests from this folder with:

```
pytest
```

## Launch with your Nano S/X

Compile and install the app on your device as normal.

To run the tests on your Ledger Nano S/X you also need to install an optional dependency

```
pip install ledgercomm[hid]
```

Be sure to have you device connected through USB (without any other software interacting with it) and run

```
pytest --hid
```

Please note that tests that require an automation file are meant for speculos, and will currently hang the test suite.
