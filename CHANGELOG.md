Dates are in `dd-mm-yyyy` format.

## [2.1.2] - 03-04-2023

### Added

- ðŸ¥• Initial support for taproot scripts; taproot trees support up to 8 leaves, and the only supported scripts in tapleaves are `pk`, `multi_a` and `sortedmulti_a`.

### Fixed

- Nested segwit transactions (P2SH-P2WPKH and P2SH-P2WSH) can now be signed (with a warning) if the PSBT contains the witness-utxo but no non-witness-utxo. This aligns their behavior to other types of Segwitv0 transactions since version 2.0.6.

## [2.1.1] - 23-01-2023

### Changed

- Allow silent xpub exports at the `m/45'/coin_type'/account'` derivation paths.
- Allow silent xpub exports for any unhardened child of an allowed path.
- Allow up to 8 derivation steps for BIP-32 paths (instead of 6).

## [2.1.0] - 16-11-2022

### Added

- Miniscript support on SegWit.
- Improved support for wallet policies.
- Support for sighash flags.

### Changed

- Wallet policies now allow external keys with no key origin information.

### Added

- Support signing of segwit V0 transactions with unverified inputs for compatibility with software unable to provide the previous transaction.

### Fixed
