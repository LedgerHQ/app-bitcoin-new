/*
Public keys in a wallet policy always have two derivation steps: the first is typically 0 or 1,
while the second step is the address index and is usually not reused in different UTXOs.
Therefore, the inputs (and change addresses) will often share the same first step.
By caching the intermediate pubkeys, we avoid recomputing the same BIP-32 pubkey derivations
multiple times. This is particularly important for transactions with many inputs, as the total
number of BIP-32 derivations is cut almost by half when using the cache.
