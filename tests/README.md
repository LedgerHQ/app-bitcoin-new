# End-to-end tests

These tests are implemented in Python and can be executed either using the [Speculos](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/speculos) emulator or a Ledger Nano S/X.

All the commands in this folder are meant to be ran from the `tests` folder, not from the root.

Python dependencies are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt), install them using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/)

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Some tests require the `bitcoind 22.0` binary to be in the `$PATH` variable, or alternatively to be set as the `BITCOIND` environment variable in the shell running the tests:

```
export BITCOIND=/path/to/my/bitcoind
```

## Launch with Speculos

Build the app as normal from the root folder. For convenience, you probably want to enable DEBUG:

```
DEBUG=1 make
```

Then run all the tests from this folder, specifying the device: nanox, nanosp, stax, flex, or all:

```
pytest --device yourdevice
```
You can enable the screen display with the option `--display`

## Launch with your Nano S/X/SP or Stax

Compile and install the app on your device as normal.

To run the tests on your Ledger device you also need to install an optional dependency

```
pip install ledgercomm[hid]
```

Be sure to have you device connected through USB (without any other software interacting with it) and run

```
pytest --device yourdevice --backend ledgercomm
```
